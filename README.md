# [Add Sound to Your Site With Web Audio][published url]
## Instructor: [Stuart Memo][instructor url]


This course is an introduction to the Web Audio API. You'll have a chance to explore this new standard for generating real-time audio in the web browser with a real-world example: adding some audio feedback to your website. In this course, you'll work with oscillators and gain, frequencies and mp3 files to create melodies that will enhance the user experience of your site.

## Source Files Description

The best place to start is by viewing the contents of index.html. You'll see
reference to scripts/audio.js, which is where the bulk of this course takes
place. There is also a play-file.js as well as a small mp3 file in the audio
directory, which is used later in the course.
